# Contributing to Alohomora
Contributions to this repository are highly appreciated, but there are few things to keep in mind to ensure your code is consistent across the project.

As Joel Spolsky once quoted, _It's harder to read code than to write it_.

## Getting Started
* Look for [issues](https://github.com/z0o0p/alohomora/issues) to work on, or [create](https://github.com/z0o0p/alohomora/issues/new) a new issue. Ensure that your issue is not similar to the existing ones.
* It is recommended that you share your approach by commenting on that issue beforehand.
* When ready to work, [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) this repository to your account.

#### Setup
Run the setup script which will help you get started.
```
sudo bash setup/setup.sh
```

## Making Changes
* Please avoid working directly on the `master` branch. Checkout to a `develop` branch from it.
* Follow the [code style](https://docs.elementary.io/develop/writing-apps/code-style) as recommended by elementary OS.
* Make commits after every logical unit.

#### Commit Message
The commit message should follow the below format.
```
Type(Optional Scope) - Message

The commit type could be Add, Fix or Update.

## Submitting Changes
* Push your changes, and create a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) to the Alohomora repository.
* Please mention the associated issue and describe the changes/additions to the code base.
