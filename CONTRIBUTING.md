# Contributing to Alohomora
Contributions to this repository are highly appreciated, but there are few things to keep in mind to ensure your code is consistent across the project. 

As Joel Spolsky once quoted, _It's harder to read code than to write it_.

## Getting Started
* Create or log in with a Github account to start contributing.
* Look for [issues](https://github.com/z0o0p/alohomora/issues) to work on, or [create](https://github.com/z0o0p/alohomora/issues/new) a new issue. Ensure that your issue is not similar to the existing ones.
* It is recommended that you share your approach by commenting on that issue beforehand.
* When ready to work, [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) this repository to your account.
* Please go through the project files and get an idea about the project to avoid confusions.

## Making Changes
* Please avoid working directly on the `master` branch by creating a `dev` branch from it.
* Follow the [code style](https://elementary.io/docs/code/reference#code-style) as recommended by elementary OS.
* Make commits after every logical unit.
* Ensure that your commit messages follow the below format. The commit message should be brief but could be expressive if you feel it is needed.
```
